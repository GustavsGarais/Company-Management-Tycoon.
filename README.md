  The page gives you random amount of money with that money you can invest in radom companys and in those companys you have graphs where you could see it growing or lowering. 
  If you choose to buy or sell determines the amount of money you gain back.
  Reach 0 you loose and start all over.
  it'll turn the money you've invested and dupe or lower the money you'll gain if you do sell it. 
  the inverstment will have some random chances to increase but also will determine of what you stock in. All companys will have their own stocks that will increase or decrease by randomness if the player does not do anything with them.
